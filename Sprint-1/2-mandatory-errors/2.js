// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

// console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
// const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

// The error here is referenceError
// To fix this, the declaration will have to move to the top

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
